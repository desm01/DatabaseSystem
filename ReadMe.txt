This is an application I made as part of a school project. I was tasked with creating a database management system for an after-school club. 

You can run it in visual studio or you can run the executable file which is in (bin/debug)

I also highly recomend checking out the user guide PDF as you will need to run the SQL code which will generate the database, create the tables and populate it with dummy data.

1.You must create the database,call it Woodside3190

2.You must run a query using the code in the Create.txt file

3.You must run a query using the code in the Insert.txt file

4.Run the application

5.Enter the connection string for your PC in the connection form
